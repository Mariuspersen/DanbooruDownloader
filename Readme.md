# dbdl.js (Danbooru Downloader)
Yet another bad danbooru downloader

## Why?
All the other one's I've used felt kinda shit, so I wanted to make a slightly worse one

### Requirements
- Just nodejs nothing else

## How to use

### Linux
In the terminal do:
```
chmod +x dbdl.js
./dbdl.js umamusume 10
```

### Window
In the terminal do:
```
node dbdl.js umamusume 10
```

Congratulations, you now have some nice horse girls
